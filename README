Welcome to the documentation for this script I wrote
1. Usage
        There are 5 main command line codes
                -f/--filename[REQUIRED ARGUMENT]: This required argument is the name of the CSV that the user will import that contains participants
                -i/--intro: Sends the introductory email to all participants provided in the -f tag CSV
                -c/--compsupp: Sends the support documentation email to all participants provided in the -f tag CSV
                -u/--send_username: Sends each user their username
                -p/--send_password: Sends each user their password
2. Debugging
       This code is mainly written using the smtplib and ssl library for sending emails. If you have any bugs that you cant fix just email me at ajsaxe@umich.edu and I can help
